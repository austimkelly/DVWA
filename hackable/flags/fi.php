<!-- Potential vulnerabilities and fixes:

The code includes a file (dvwaPage.inc.php) without proper input validation, which can lead to local file inclusion vulnerabilities. To fix this, the code should validate the input and sanitize it before including the file.
The code uses the base64_decode() function to decode a string, which can be used to obfuscate malicious code. To fix this, the code should avoid using base64-encoded strings and instead use plain text or a secure encryption algorithm.
The code contains a commented-out line that suggests the use of hidden content, which can be used to hide malicious code or sensitive information. To fix this, the code should avoid using hidden content and instead use proper access controls and authentication mechanisms to protect sensitive information.
